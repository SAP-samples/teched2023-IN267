Enterprise IT landscapes are becoming increasingly complex, hybrid and multi-vendor. APIs are used to expose a company's data and make enterprise assets available to internal and external business users. As the interfaces of the digital building blocks of composable architectures, APIs:

-   Provide interoperability and data sharing between software systems.
-   Enable the integration and innovation of new products and services.
-   Are critical for creating an ecosystem of 3rd party solutions.
-   Are a source of revenue in the cloud-native economy.

APIs are often exposed to 3rd parties, including business partners and customers. More and more businesses are using APIs to generate new revenue streams, such as through consumption-based pricing or pay-per-use models.

APIs have become **business critical assets**, and as such, *must be carefully managed and secured.*

SAP is aware of the importance of APIs, their security, and management. The API Management capability in SAP Integration Suite is a complete solution that addresses all enterprise requirements for API security and governance. New in 2023 is the ability to create powerful *data graphs*, abstracting an entire landscape with a single API to a connected graph of the data in that landscape.

In this session, we will take a deeper look at SAPâ€™s API Management solution, by building a data graph extension, and protecting this with an API Proxy with the appropriate security policies.

Start the exercises [here](exercise/README.md).
