# LET THE FUN BEGIN

In this exercise, you will...

## Step 1 ‚Äì login to the Integration Suite

If you were given an odd user ID number (user01, user03,‚Ä¶, user31, ...), use the following BLR13 URL:

```
https://teched23blr13.integrationsuite.cfapps.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
```

Users with an even user ID numbers (user02, user04, ‚Ä¶), use the following BLR08 URL:
```
https://teched23blr08.integrationsuite.cfapps.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
```

## Step 2 ‚Äì Create a Business Data Graph
Click on the top-left hamburger, so you can see the menu of the SAP Integration Suite on the left.

Then, select Design => Graph from the menu. 

![Pic 1](images/IN267_ex0_1.png)

You see the Graph wizard. There may be several data graphs already created by other course participants. Just ignore them.
![Pic 2](images/IN267_ex0_2.png)

On the Business Data Graphs tab, and start the wizard, Create => New business data graph.
![Pic 3](images/IN267_ex0_3.png)

Enter an ID for the data graph. This name must be unique, and therefore must start with uNN, where NN is your user id. For instance, if your tenant-user is ‚Äúuser31‚Äù, you can name the data graph u31-rp.
![Pic 4](images/IN267_ex0_4.png)

Note the resulting Graph URL. The data graph ID is the last part of this URL.


Click on Next and check the two data sources we will use for our data graph. 
![Pic 5](images/IN267_ex0_5.png)

Click Next and in the next step select the my-ratedpartner model extension. Click Next again and wait about 20 seconds. The Graph system is checking your data sources, discovering and connecting entities, and creating a data graph configuration. When complete, you will see the configuration. If you made a mistake, check the logs, cancel, and try again.

The configuration can be fine-tuned for complex use cases and landscapes, but we just click on Create and wait about two minutes, for the system to instantiate and run the data graph. During this time, you will see a status of Processing. 
![Pic 6](images/IN267_ex0_6.png)
When the status turns to ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù, the URL is live, and we are ready to check it out, using the Graph Navigator.

## Step 3 ‚Äì Use the Graph Navigator

There is little ‚Äúkeypad‚Äù on the right of the top-bar. Click it, and then select Graph Navigator.

![Pic 7](images/IN267_ex0_7.png)

When the Navigator comes up, select the data graph you just created, then select the bestrun namespace, and within that the RatedPartner entity which we defined. You can see the documented schema and an example.

![Pic 8](images/IN267_ex0_8.png)

The Graph navigator is connected to live data, the example comes from a real system. 

Now, click on the Try Out tab, and click Run to see how to execute an OData query. By changing the query, you can get powerful results. For instance, you could try the following queries (don‚Äôt copy paste ‚Äì type these in and be impressed by the OData auto-completion feature of the Graph Navigator üòä): 

```
/bestrun/RatedPartner?$top=10&$expand=location&$select=name,rating
```

```
/bestrun/RatedPartner?$top=30&$filter=rating/Moodys eq 'AAB'

```
Note that the data graph also includes other entities (in other namespaces) in the data graph, and you can still access these other entities, using the same Graph API and URL.

When done, you can close the browser tab.

## Step 4 ‚Äì Create an API Proxy

As we saw, the Graph API is a powerful abstraction, providing access to the underlying data with one API. But what if we want to really limit our client to only use the new RatedPartner abstraction?

In the following step, we will add an API Proxy to the Graph API, which will have two purposes: one, it will limit access only to the new RatedPartner URL, and two, it will limit access to only three calls per minute.

You should still be on the Graph page in the SAP Integration Suite (if not, click Design => Graph). Find the data graph we just created in the list. Carefully copy the URL of that data graph.

From the menu, click Design => APIs and then Create. 

![Pic 9](images/IN267_ex0_9.png)

A form pops up.
The form must be filled in as follows:
‚Ä¢	Select the ‚ÄúURL‚Äù radio button.
‚Ä¢	Paste the data graph URL you just copied in the target URL; then append /bestrun to the end of the URL. 
‚Ä¢	Name the API proxy. This name must be unique, and therefore must start with uNN, where NN is your tenant user id. For instance, if your tenant-user is ‚Äúuser31‚Äù, you can name the API proxy u31-proxy.
‚Ä¢	Copy the same name into the title and API Base Path fields.
‚Ä¢	Click Create.

![Pic 10](images/IN267_ex0_10.png)

‚Ä¢	Click Save.

![Pic 11](images/IN267_ex0_11.png)

Note the API proxy URL at the top of the screen (including ‚Äúprod.apimanagement‚Äù, ending with the API base path that you configured just now. Most customers would actually create a nicer-looking ‚Äúvanity‚Äù URL (e.g., api.bestrun.com/u31-proxy) for their API proxy, completely hiding the ‚Äúinternal URLs‚Äù behind a firewall. This is beyond this exercise.

![Pic 12](images/IN267_ex0_12.png)

Now let‚Äôs add a quota policy to our API Proxy. Click on Policies, and on Edit on the Policy Editor.

Select the ProxyEndPoint, and then its Preflow. Now, on the right, scroll until you find the Quota Policy. 

![Pic 13](images/IN267_ex0_13.png)

Click on the plus (+) and give it a name, e.g. my-quota and Add. This will add the policy to API Proxy. 


At the bottom you will find the policy configuration:

![Pic 14](images/IN267_ex0_14.png)

The default policy allows a count of two calls per one (1) minute. Go ahead, change the allow-count to 3. We will test this later.

Now, click Update, and Save. 

![Pic 15](images/IN267_ex0_15.png)

Note that the API proxy is not yet deployed. Select the ellipsis (‚Ä¶) on the right, and Deploy. Done!

If you now try to click on the API proxy URL (go ahead, try), the call will fail. Why? The API Proxy, by default, propagates the identity and authentication credentials from the caller to its target URL, here the data graph. The data graph expects an OAuth 2.0 authentication token, and since we just clicked on a link, this fails.

We will check this out further in the next step. Copy the URL of the API Proxy from the screen.


## Step 5 ‚Äì Use CURL to test the API Proxy

The API proxy that we just created has no specific authentication policy; the OAuth authentication credentials are simply passed to the data graph. In this step, we will use the ‚Äúcurl‚Äù command to obtain an authentication token, and then use that token to make a call to the API.

Open a command terminal on your PC (on Windows, use ÔÉøR, and enter cmd).

In the terminal that opens, type:

On BLR13 (odd user id):
```
curl -X POST https://teched23blr13.authentication.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -d "client_id=sb-90232f75-ebad-47e9-8493-08feb06da7b9!b30456|sap-graph!b24139" -d "client_secret=1c20ad72-12f9-418b-af1f-a8453dac5c24$LXIq-pMUivmjcBYvF_omsogO1KyAM9hTi5nQYEmbEiM="
```
On BLR08 (even user id):
```
curl -X POST https://teched23blr08.authentication.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -d "client_id=sb-8906f3c8-452d-4215-baf4-29ed89d16df1!b28124|sap-graph!b24139" -d "client_secret=4cc39d9d-5e98-4164-954d-6b2cc0326249$iZEnuNDvCpX0yeP86SzyA-BnudBdudzFiopbkJzXYzs="
```
If all goes well, you will see a response with an access token. 

![Pic 16](images/IN267_ex0_16.png)

Carefully select and copy the string.

We will also need the URL of the API proxy. But remember, that is the URL of the bestrun namespace. You need to append an entity query, for example, /RatedPartner?$top=1 to that URL.

So, now that we have a token and URL, enter the following curl command, 

curl -X GET <url> -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>"


and substitute <url> with the URL of the API proxy with the entity query, and substitute <access-token> with the access token you just copied:

```
curl -X GET https://teched23blr... /RatedPartner?$top=1 -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJh...Q"
```
The response should look like this:
```
{"@odata.context":"$metadata#RatedPartner","value":[{"id":"my.custom~1000000","name":"HA_SUPPLIER","isActive":true,"rating":{"Moodys":"ABB","Fitch":"B","StandardPoor":"B+","totalScore":"acceptable"}}]}
```
Repeat this last command a few times. What happens? Cool, no?

## Step 6 ‚Äì Add an OAuth policy template 

What if we want to enable ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù and unauthenticated (but still carefully controlled) access to our data graph, which still expects an OAuth 2.0 token?

For this, we will learn how to use a Policy Template, called ‚ÄúCloud_Platform_Connectivity‚Äù. You can find this policy template, and many, many more on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. The documentation for the template we are using can be found here: https://hub.sap.com/policytemplate/Cloud_Platform_Connectivity.

Go back to Design => APIs in the SAP Integration Suite application.
Select your API proxy from the list of APIs. At the top, click Policies and on the Policy Editor, click Edit.

![Pic 17](images/IN267_ex0_17.png)

Click on Policy Template => Apply in the top corner.

Check the Cloud_Platform_Connectivity template and Apply.
The policies from the template now appear in the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù under the TargetEndPoint.

We now need to insert the client ID and client secret in the getcredential policy, and the URL used to grant a token, in the getoauthtoken policy. Start with the the getcredential policy. Select this policy in the picture. The configuration is at the bottom of the screen. 

![Pic 18](images/IN267_ex0_18.png)

BLR13 OAuth credentials (odd user Id)
Client id	sb-90232f75-ebad-47e9-8493-08feb06da7b9!b30456|sap-graph!b24139
Client secret	1c20ad72-12f9-418b-af1f-a8453dac5c24$LXIq-pMUivmjcBYvF_omsogO1KyAM9hTi5nQYEmbEiM=

BLR08 OAuth credentials (even user ids)
Client id	sb-8906f3c8-452d-4215-baf4-29ed89d16df1!b28124|sap-graph!b24139
Client secret	4cc39d9d-5e98-4164-954d-6b2cc0326249$iZEnuNDvCpX0yeP86SzyA-BnudBdudzFiopbkJzXYzs=

Then select the getoauthtoken policy. Change the access token URL as follows: 

![Pic 19](images/IN267_ex0_19.png)

BLR13	https://teched23blr13.authentication.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials

BLR08	https://teched23blr08.authentication.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials

Ok. We are almost done‚Ä¶ Click Update, then Save, and then Click to Deploy and Yes to deploy the changes.

Now, enter the URL of the API proxy in a browser tab (remember? You can find the URL in the list of API proxies). Remember to append, for example, /RatedPartner?$top=3, in order to see a bit of data. 

With the additional policies from the policy template, the API proxy now handles the OAuth protocol on behalf of the caller, and the data graph is available for ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù usage. 

Refresh the page. After 2 or 3 times (depending on how you configured the quota policy), access will be denied.

## Step 7 ‚Äì Publish the URL

What is an API good for, if developers don‚Äôt know about it?
In this step, we will create an API grouping, called a Product, and then publish the group of APIs to the API Business Hub Enterprise (ABHE), where developers with be able to learn about the API.

From the menu, click Design => APIs, click on the Products tab and then Create. Give the product a unique name, like u31-myproduct:

![Pic 20](images/IN267_ex0_20.png)

To publish a product, it has to have APIs. Click on the APIs tab, then Add. Find the API that we created in the first step and click OK.

![Pic 21](images/IN267_ex0_21.png)

Click on Publish. You may see other Products, published by other participants.

## Step 8 ‚Äì the developer portal: API Business Hub Enterprise

Enter the developer portal, called API Business Hub Enterprise, from the little keypad menu on the right:

![Pic 22](images/IN267_ex0_22.png)

As an administrator, you can manage how developers access information on this portal. Most customers will provide developers self-service access, so they can explore the APIs and obtain the necessary credentials. You can also generate credentials yourself, and selectively hand these to your developers, which is what we will do today.

Now click on a product tile, and then Subscribe, => Create New Application:

![Pic 23](images/IN267_ex0_23.png)

Provide a title, and check Create this application on behalf of someone else. Select one of the registered developers for whom you are generating the credentials, from the dropdown


![Pic 24](images/IN267_ex0_24.png)

And, finally, add the product that we just created in step 7, by clicking on the + box:


![Pic 25](images/IN267_ex0_25.png)

And click OK and then Save. 

You can now hand the generated credentials to the developer, who can use them to build a new application. 

## Bonus step ‚Äì customize the developer portal

You will have noticed that there is a ‚ÄúNew Design‚Äù feature, at the top of the page. As an administrator of the API Business Hub Enterprise, you can turn this on and customize the look and feel of the developer portal.

![Pic 26](images/IN267_ex0_26.png)

As a bonus for reaching the end of this exercise, feel free to switch to the new design, and experiment changing the look and feel of the developer portal. Keep in mind that these changes are going to affect all other participants, and their changes may surprisingly affect yours.


That‚Äòs it! You made it to the end!

Enjoy the rest of TechEd!
